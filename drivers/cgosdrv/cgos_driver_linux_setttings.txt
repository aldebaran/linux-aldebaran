CGOS driver settings:
---------------------

* Manage access to CGOS driver:

  To allow certain or all users/groups access to the CGOS interface,
  rights need to be changed. This is only valid until a reboot.

  For example, r/w access for everyone:

  cd /dev
  sudo chmod 0666 cgos -R

  permission to:  owner      group      other     
                  /¯¯¯\      /¯¯¯\      /¯¯¯\
  octal:            6          6          6
  binary:         1 1 0      1 1 0      1 1 0
  what to permit: r w x      r w x      r w x

  binary         - 1: enabled, 0: disabled

  what to permit - r: read, w: write, x: execute

  permission to  - owner: the user that create the file/folder
                   group: the users from group that owner is member
                   other: all other users


* Load cgosdrv module into kernel at startup by default:

  sudo gedit /etc/modules

  Append 'cgosdrv' to the list, for example the file should now look like this:

  -------------------

  # /etc/modules: kernel modules to load at boot time. 
  #
  # This file contains the names of kernel modules that should be loaded
  # at boot time, one per line. Lines beginning with "#" are ignored.
  # Parameters can be specified after the module name.
  
  lp
  rtc
  cgosdrv
