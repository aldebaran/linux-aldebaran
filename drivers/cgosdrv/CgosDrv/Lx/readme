README for building the CGOS 64bit API for the Linux Operating system
=====================================================================

1. General
----------
This package provides the CGOS (congatec OS API) driver for 64bit Linux.

Currently kernel versions 2.6.x, 3.x and 4.x are supported. Please
contact your local congatec sales partner if you need support for
other kernels.

The CGOS API is well documented in the CGOS API manual, which can
be found on our web page.


2. How to build the driver standalone 
-------------------------------------
It is possible to build the driver separately as a module. In other words,
there's no requirement for including the driver into the kernel build
mechanism. In this case it's necessary to specify the correct values for
the kernel source directory ($KERNELDIR).

In order to build the complete package for the specified kernel version,
simply issue a "make" command at the top level directory. 

The kernel source directory is set to "/lib/modules/`uname -r`/build"
by default. To change this setting, just specify KERNELDIR when executing
the make command, e.g. "make KERNELDIR=<path_to_your_kernel_sources>"

Previous builds of the CGOS library created the device node /dev/cgos automatically
by executing "mknod /dev/cgos c 99 0". This outdated method of creating the 
device node has been removed in version 1.03.019. Instead support for udev
has been added:

The driver creates a miscdevice and assigns the major number 10. The minor 
number is assigned automatically. 

3. How to include the driver into the kernel build mechanism
------------------------------------------------------------
Following instructions are suitable
to include the driver into the standard kernel build mechanism.
Assuming your kernel source code is located in /usr/src/linux:

- copy the directory CgosDrv to /usr/src/linux/drivers
- copy the directory CgosLib to /usr/src/linux/drivers
- include the driver in your kernel build mechanism:

   add "obj-$(CONFIG_CGOS) += CgosDrv/Lx/"
   to the driver makefile (/usr/src/linux/drivers/Makefile)

   add "source drivers/CgosDrv/Lx/Kconfig" to the device driver 
   configuration file (/usr/src/linux/drivers/Kconfig), e.g
   directly after the parport entry ("source drivers/parport/Kconfig")
     
- configure the kernel
  
  execute "make menuconfig" for kernel configuration
  check "Congatec OS API (CGOS) support" either as built-in feature or
  as module

- build the kernel


4. SELinux
----------

Starting with version 1.03.019, the following improvements have been introduced in order 
to support SELinux:

- libcgos.so and libcgosp.o are now compiled with the -fPIC compiler switch to 
create position independent code in order to avoid text relocations.

- the memory allocation method for the CGEB code has been changed in order to
allocate memory that is executable.


5. Troubleshooting
------------------

Some common error messages that could appear after running the make command are for
example:

- scripts/genksyms/genksyms: No such file or directory
- /bin/sh: scripts/mod/modpost: not found
- Kernel configuration is invalid. include/linux/autoconf.h or include/config/auto.conf 
  are missing. Run ‘make oldconfig && make prepare’ on kernel src to fix it.
- WARNING: Symbol version dump /usr/src/linux-2.6.29/Module.symvers is missing; 
  module will have no dependencies and modversions.

After making sure that the kernel sources against which the modules are going 
to be built are installed, the following procedure may resolve any or all of the 
above error messages (for example, if your kernel version is 2.6.29-1-686):

# cd /lib/modules/2.6.29-1-686/
# ln -s /usr/src/linux-source-2.6.29 build
# cd /usr/src/linux-source-2.6.29
# make mrproper
# cp /boot/config-$(uname -r) .config
# make oldconfig
# make prepare
# make scripts

Finally, navigate to the directory where the CGOS sources reside
and run make:

# cd /usr/src/cgoslx-.../
# make clean
# make
